# Crowdfunding Analysis Project

This README provides an overview of a class project involving analyzing a database of 1,000 sample crowdfunding projects. The goal of the analysis is to uncover trends, patterns, and insights from the data using Excel. Below is a breakdown of the tasks performed and the key findings from the analysis. 
Data for this dataset was generated by edX Boot Camps LLC, and is intended for educational purposes only.

## Background:
Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have gained popularity as a means for individuals and organizations to raise funds for their projects. The success of a crowdfunding campaign is determined by whether it meets or exceeds its funding goal. This project aimed to analyze a dataset of 1,000 sample crowdfunding projects to identify trends that contribute to campaign success.

### Tasks Performed:

Conditional Formatting: The outcome column was color-coded to represent successful, failed, canceled, or live campaigns.

Percent Funded: A new column, "Percent Funded," was created to calculate how much a campaign raised relative to its initial goal. Conditional formatting was applied to represent different levels using a three-color scale.

Average Donation: A column was added to calculate the average amount each backer contributed to a campaign.

Parent Category and Sub-Category: New columns were created by splitting the Category and Sub-Category column data.

Category and Sub-Category Analysis: Pivot tables and charts were used to analyze the count of successful, failed, canceled, and live campaigns per category and sub-category.

Date Conversion: Columns for Date Created Conversion and Date Ended Conversion were added to convert Unix timestamps to Excel's date format.

Outcomes Based on Launch Date: A pivot table and line graph were created to visualize campaign outcomes based on launch dates.

Crowdfunding Goal Analysis: A table and graph were generated to show the relationship between campaign goals and success rates.

Statistical Analysis: A summary statistics table was created to compare the number of backers for successful and unsuccessful campaigns. Metrics such as mean, median, minimum, maximum, variance, and standard deviation were calculated.

### Key Findings:
1.	According to the dataset analyzed, it is observed that fundraising through Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have 73% average chance of success as compared to 25% chance of failure and 2% chance of cancelation. It was interesting to find that projects with Goals between 15000 to 19999, 20000 to 24999 and 30000 to 34999 saw 100% rate of success, although it is worth mentioning that these were small amounts of projects; about 24 out of over 82 total. Campaigns with smaller funding goals tended to have higher success rates. As the goal amount increased, success rates decreased. The least rate of success projects fell within the goals of 50000 and above. Fundraisers would like to take note of the goal range as they launch their campaigns.

2.	Categorical Analysis: Looking at campaign summary by category, theater especially Plays seemed to perform better than all the other categories with 187 successes out of a total of 344 and it was also the category with the highest total of campaigns. In second place was Film and Video with 102 out of 172 successes. The least performing categories were Photography, Games and Food; an information backers might find interesting when supporting future projects. It is interesting to note that 100% of Journalism campaigns were successfully funded although it is worth noting the total number of campaign (4) was very small to make viable conclusions but it could be a good start for future campaigners.

3.	Campaign Duration: Projects launched in specific months appear to have a higher chance of success. The data shows that campaigns were at their highest point of yearly success in June and peaks in July. Success rate deeps considerably in August and continues the low trend up to December. Also, chances of failure and cancelation goes up in December while success rate falls. The data shows, it will be more advantageous for Campaign launchers to kickstart in the height of the summer months in order to increase their success rate.

Backer Analysis: Successful campaigns had higher median and mean numbers of backers compared to unsuccessful ones. This indicates that more backers contribute to a campaign's success.

The mean and median are not similar for both Successful and Failed Categories, which indicates the data is not normally distributed.																		
Also the variance of the number of backers is quite large which indicates the data is skewed. As such the Median might be a better option to summarize the data.																		
The data indicates there is more variability with successful than unsuccessful campaigns. It makes sense because there are more backers of successful campaigns than Unsuccessful ones.

### Limitations of the Dataset:

Missing Factors: The dataset may not account for all factors influencing campaign success, such as marketing strategies, project uniqueness, and creator reputation.

Timeframe: The dataset's timeframe may not reflect current trends and market behaviors in crowdfunding.

Reward Levels vs. Backers: A graph comparing different reward levels offered by campaigns against the number of backers could reveal trends in supporter preferences.

Campaign Duration vs. Success: Analyzing the relationship between campaign duration and success rates might unveil optimal campaign lengths.

### Recommendations for further analysis
It will be interesting to do more analysis on how long the projects took and if the length of time impacted the rate of success. 

Also, use of Scatter plots charts can help in identifying other patterns in the dataset including success and failure rate variables, outliers etc.

### Conclusion:
The analysis of the crowdfunding dataset revealed insights related to launch dates, funding goals, and backer engagement. While limitations exist, the trends observed can inform crowdfunding strategies. Additional analyses and visualizations can provide even deeper insights into campaign success factors.
